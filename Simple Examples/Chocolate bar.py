# Chocolate bar has the form of a rectangle divided into n√óm portions.
# Chocolate bar can be split into two rectangular parts by breaking it along a selected straight line on its pattern.
# Determine whether it is possible to split it so that one of the parts will have exactly k squares.
# The program reads three integers: n, m, and k. It should print YES or NO.
